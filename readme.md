asses 2 AND 3

uses OOPS :O

instructions to run:

    python3 main.py
```

OOPS concepts:

- inheritence: Standard_brick, exploding_brick and unbreakable brick all inherit parent class parent_brick
- Polymorphism: the show function of each class, hit for the different kinds of bricks amongst others
- Encapsulatoion: all functionality done with classes and objects
- abstraction: class functions hide the inner workings of each function appropriately behind well descriptive function names
